<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Viola</span>, <span class="smcap">Roberto</span>, <i>and two Sailors, carrying a
Trunk</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Vio.</i> What country, friends, is this?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Rob.</i> This is Illyria, lady.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Vio.</i> And what should I do in Illyria?<br />
My brother he is in Elysium.<br />
Perchance, he is not drown'd:&mdash;What think you, sailors?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Rob.</i> It is perchance, that you yourself were saved.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Vio.</i> O my poor brother! and so, perchance may he be.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Rob.</i> True, madam; and, to comfort you with chance,<br />
Assure yourself, after our ship did split,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
When you, and that poor number saved with you,<br />
Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,<br />
Most provident in peril, bind himself<br />
(Courage and hope both teaching him the practice)<br />
To a strong mast, that lived upon the sea;<br />
Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,<br />
I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves,<br />
So long as I could see.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Vio.</i> Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,<br />
Whereto thy speech serves for authority,<br />
The like of him. Know'st thou this country?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Rob.</i> Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born,<br />
Not three hours travel from this very place.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Vio.</i> Who governs here?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Rob.</i> A noble duke, in nature,
As in his name.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Vio.</i> What is his name?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Rob.</i> Orsino.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Vio.</i> Orsino!&mdash;I have heard my father name him:<br />
He was a bachelor then.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Rob.</i> And so is now,<br />
Or was so very late: for but a month<br />
Ago I went from hence; and then 'twas fresh<br />
In murmur, (as, you know, what great ones do,<br />
The less will prattle of,) that he did seek<br />
The love of fair Olivia.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Vio.</i> What is she?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Rob.</i> A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count<br />
That died some twelvemonth since; then leaving her<br />
In the protection of his son, her brother,<br />
Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,<br />
They say, she hath abjured the company<br />
And sight of men.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Vio.</i> Oh, that I served that lady!<br />
And might not be deliver'd to the world,<br />
Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,<br />
What my estate is!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Rob.</i> That were hard to compass;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
Because she will admit no kind of suit,<br />
No, not the duke's.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Vio.</i> There is a fair behaviour in thee, captain;<br />
And, I believe, thou hast a mind that suits<br />
With this thy fair and outward character.<br />
I pray thee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,<br />
Conceal me what I am; and be my aid<br />
For such disguise as, haply, shall become<br />
The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke;<br />
Thou shalt present me as a page unto him,<br />
Of gentle breeding, and my name, Cesario:&mdash;<br />
That trunk, the reliques of my sea-drown'd brother,<br />
Will furnish man's apparel to my need:&mdash;<br />
It may be worth thy pains: for I can sing,<br />
And speak to him in many sorts of music,<br />
That will allow me very worth his service.<br />
What else may hap, to time I will commit;<br />
Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Rob.</i> Be you his page, and I your mute will be;<br />
When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Vio.</i> I thank thee:&mdash;Lead me on.</p>

<p><i>Duke.</i> [<i>Music.</i>] If music be the food of love, play on,<br />
Give me excess of it; that, surfeiting,<br />
The appetite may sicken, and so die.&mdash;&mdash;<br />
[<i>Music.</i>] That strain again;&mdash;it had a dying fall:<br />
O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet south,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
That breathes upon a bank of violets,<br />
Stealing, and giving odours.&mdash;<br />
[<i>Music.</i>] Enough; no more;       [<i>He rises.</i><br />
'Tis not so sweet now, as it was before.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Cur.</i> Will you go hunt, my lord?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Duke.</i> What, Curio?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Cur.</i> The hart.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Duke.</i> Why, so I do, the noblest that I have:<br />
O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,<br />
Methought, she purged the air of pestilence;<br />
That instant was I turn'd into a hart;<br />
And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,<br />
E'er since pursue me.</p>

<p>How now? what news from my Olivia?&mdash;speak.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Val.</i> So please my lord, I might not be admitted;<br />
But from her handmaid do return this answer;<br />
The element itself, till seven years heat,<br />
Shall not behold her face at ample view;<br />
But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk,<br />
And water once a day her chamber round<br />
With eye-offending brine: all this, to season<br />
A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh,<br />
And lasting, in her sad remembrance.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Duke.</i> O, she, that hath a heart of that fine frame,<br />
To pay this debt of love but to a brother,<br />
How will she love, when the rich golden shaft<br />
Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else<br />
That live in her!&mdash;<br />
Away before me to sweet beds of flowers;<br />
Love-thoughts lie rich, when canopied with bowers.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Maria</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Sir Toby Belch</span>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir To.</i> What a plague means my niece, to take
the death of her brother thus? I am sure, care's an
enemy to life.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mar.</i> By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in
earlier o' nights; your niece, my lady, takes great
exceptions to your ill hours.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir To.</i> Why, let her except before excepted.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mar.</i> Ay, but you must confine yourself within
the modest limits of order.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir To.</i> Confine? I'll confine myself no finer than
I am: these clothes are good enough to drink in, and
so be these boots too; an they be not, let them hang
themselves in their own straps.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mar.</i> That quaffing and drinking will undo you;
I heard my lady talk of it yesterday; and of a foolish
knight, that you have brought in here, to be her
wooer.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir To.</i> Who? Sir Andrew Ague-cheek?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mar.</i> Ay, he.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir To.</i> He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mar.</i> What's that to the purpose?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir To.</i> Why, he has three thousand ducats a-year.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mar.</i> Ay, but he'll have but a year in all these
ducats; he's a very fool, and a prodigal.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir To.</i> Fye, that you'll say so! he plays o' the
viol-de-gambo, and hath all the good gifts of nature.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mar.</i> He hath, indeed, all, most natural; for, besides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
that he's a fool, he's a great quarreller; and,
but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust
he hath in quarrelling, 'tis thought among the prudent,
he would quickly have the gift of a grave.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir To.</i> By this band, they are scoundrels, and substractors,
that say so of him. Who are they?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mar.</i> They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly
in your company.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir To.</i> With drinking healths to my niece; I'll
drink to her, as long as there is a passage in my
throat, and drink in Illyria: He's a coward, and a
coystril, that will not drink to my niece, till his brains
turn o' the toe like a parish-top&mdash;See, here comes
Sir Andrew Ague-face.</p>

<p class="right">[<span class="smcap">Sir Andrew Ague-cheek</span>, <i>without</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir And.</i> Bless you, fair shrew.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mar.</i> And you too, sir.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir To.</i> Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir And.</i> What's that?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir To.</i> My niece's chamber-maid.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir And.</i> Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mar.</i> My name is Mary, sir.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir And.</i> Good Mistress Mary Accost,&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir To.</i> You mistake, knight; accost, is, front her,
board her, woo her, assail her.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir And.</i> By my troth, I would not undertake her
in this company. Is that the meaning of accost?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mar.</i> Fare you well, gentlemen.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir To.</i> An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, 'would
thou might'st never draw sword again.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir And.</i> An you part so, mistress, I would I might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
never draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think
you have fools in hand?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mar.</i> Sir, I have not you by the hand.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir And.</i> Marry, but you shall have; and here's
my hand.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mar.</i> [<i>Takes his hand.</i>] Now, sir, thought is free:
I pray you, bring your hand to the buttery-bar, and
let it drink.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir And.</i> Wherefore, sweet-heart? what's your
metaphor?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mar.</i> It's dry, sir.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir And.</i> Why, I think so; I am not such an ass,
but I can keep my hand dry. But what's your jest?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mar.</i> A dry jest, sir.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir And.</i> Are you full of them?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mar.</i> Ay, sir; I have them at my fingers' ends:
marry, [<i>Lets go his hand.</i>] now I let go your hand, I
am barren.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Maria</span>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir To.</i> O knight, thou lack'st a cup of canary:
When did I see thee so put down?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir And.</i> Never in your life, I think; unless you
see canary put me down: Methinks, sometimes I
have no more wit than a Christian, or an ordinary
man has; but I am a great eater of beef, and, I believe,
that does harm to my wit.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir To.</i> No question.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir And.</i> An I thought that, I'd forswear it. I'll
ride home to-morrow, Sir Toby.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir To.</i> <i>Pourquoy</i>, my dear knight?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir And.</i> What is <i>pourquoy</i>? do, or not do? I
would I had bestow'd that time in the tongues, that
I have in fencing, dancing, and bear-baiting: O,
had I but follow'd the arts!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir To.</i> Then hadst thou had an excellent head of
hair.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir And.</i> Why, would that have mended my hair?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir To.</i> Past question; for, thou seest, it will not
curl by nature.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
<i>Sir And.</i> But it becomes me well enough, does't
not?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir To.</i> Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff;
and I hope to see a housewife take thee between her
legs, and spin it off.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir And.</i> 'Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby:
your niece will not be seen; or, if she be, it's four to
one she'll none of me: the duke himself, here hard
by, wooes her.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir To.</i> She'll none o' the duke; she'll not match
above her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit;
I have heard her swear it. Tut, there's life in't,
man.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir And.</i> I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow
o' the strangest mind i' the world; I delight in
masques and revels sometimes altogether.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir To.</i> Art thou good at these kick-shaws, knight?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir And.</i> As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be,

<i>Seb.</i> By your patience, no: my stars shine darkly
over me; the malignancy of my fate might, perhaps,
distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you your
leave, that I may bear my evils alone: It were a bad
recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you.</p>

bound.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Seb.</i> No, 'sooth, sir; my determinate voyage is
mere extravagancy.&mdash;But I perceive in you so excellent
a touch of modesty, that you will not extort from
me what I am willing to keep in; therefore it charges
me in manners the rather to express myself.&mdash;You
must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,
which I called Rodorigo; my father was that
Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard
of: He left behind him, myself, and a sister, both
born in an hour. If the heavens had been pleased,
'would we had so ended! But you, sir, altered that;
for, some hour before you took me from the breach
of the sea, was my sister drowned.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Ant.</i> Alas, the day!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Seb.</i> A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled
me, was yet of many accounted beautiful:
but, though I could not overfar believe that, yet thus
far I will boldly publish her, she bore a mind that
envy could not but call fair.       [<i>He weeps.</i>]</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Ant.</i> If you will not murder me for my love, let me
be your servant.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Seb.</i> If you will not undo what you have done, that
is, kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not.
Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full of kindness;
and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that,
upon the least occasion more, mine eyes will tell
tales of me. I am bound to the Duke Orsino's court,
farewell.</p>

I should your lordship.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Duke.</i> And what's her history?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Vio.</i> A blank, my lord: She never told her love,<br />
But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,<br />
Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought;<br />
And, with a green and yellow melancholy,<br />
She sat like patience on a monument,<br />
Smiling at grief. Was not this love, indeed?<br />
We men may say more, swear more: but, indeed,<br />
Our shows are more than will, for still we prove<br />
Much in our vows, but little in our love.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
